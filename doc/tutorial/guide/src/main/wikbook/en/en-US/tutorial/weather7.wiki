Our application is almost complete, in this section we will work on the look and feel to make the application
appealing. We will use the famous [[Twitter Bootstrap>>http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/]] framework and show how
it integrates well in Juzu applications.

= The style =

Bootstrap provides a solid fundation for building quickly attractive applications.  Bootstrap is based on the dynamic
stylesheet language [[Less>>http://lesscss.org/]] and provides a very modular organization. We will perform trivial
modifications to a subset of the Less files and integrate them in our application.

== A la carte ==

We will then modify the ##bootstrap.less## file to keep only what is necessary for our application:

{{example title="The necessary Bootstrap less files"}}
{{code href="examples/tutorial/assets/bootstrap.less"/}}
{{/example}}

This version of bootstrap.less is a trimmed down of the original files.

= Plugins in action =

Juzu can be extended with plugins, in this section we will use two of them

* The Less plugin compiles less files into css files
* The Asset plugin inject asset such as stylesheet or javascript in the application page

== Less compilation ==

Juzu provides native support for the Less language via the Less plugin and the ##@Less## annotation. It allows a set of less
files to be transformed into the corresponding css files during the java compilation, achieving two important steps during
the compilation phase:

* The less files are transformed into ready to use css files
* It ensures a maximum of safety: the Less parser will report any error in the source

Our first step is to create the ##examples.tutorial.assets## package, we copy the Bootstrap Less files into this package and
annotate the ##examples.tutorial## package with the ##@Less## annotation to trigger the compilation of the stylesheet
 in the ##assets## package:

{{java}}
@Less(value = "bootstrap.less", minify = true)
package examples.tutorial;

import juzu.plugin.less.Less;
{{/java}}

This annotation triggers the compilation of the ##bootstrap.less## in the ##assets## package, the ##minified## parameter
instruct Less to minify the resulting css.

== Injecting CSS ==

Now that we have worked out the CSS details we need to make our stylesheet available in the application page. The //asset//
plugin will achieve this result for us. This plugin provides declarative configuration for the various assets required
by an application. It works both for stylesheets and javascript, in this section we use it for stylesheet:

{{example title="Injecting Bootstrap CSS in our application"}}
{{java}}
@Application
@Assets(stylesheets = @Stylesheet(
  src = "/examples/tutorial/assets/bootstrap.css",
  location = AssetLocation.CLASSPATH)
)
package examples.tutorial.weather7;
{{/java}}
{{/example}}

The usage is fairly straightforward with the ##@Assets## and ##Stylesheet## annotations. We configure the ##location## parameter
to be ##CLASSPATH## because the Less plugin created it there.

== Bringing CSS to life ==

After this step we need to modify our application template to use the various styles provided by Bootstrap:

[[image:images/bootstrap.png||title="The Bootstrapized application" align="center" html:scale="70" fo:width="70mm]]

We will not explain that in details, however we will study the important modifications:

=== Accordion ===

The Bootstrap provides the [[Collapse component>>http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#collapse]]. We will
not use the entire Collapse component here but instead reuse the CSS rules to display the available cities:

{{code}}
<div class="accordion-group">
  <div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" href="@{index(location = current)}">${current}</a></div>
  <div class="accordion-body">
    <div class="accordion-inner">The weather temperature in ${current} is ${temperature}&deg; ${grade.toUpperCase()}.</div>
  </div>
</div>
{{/code}}

=== Adding a city ===

Finally the form for adding is modified to reuse [[Bootstrap form support>>http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms]]:

{{code}}
<form action="@{add()}" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <div class="controls">
      <div class="input-append">
         <input class="span2" type="text" size="16"name="location" value=""/>
         <button type="submit" class="btn">Add</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
{{/code}}
