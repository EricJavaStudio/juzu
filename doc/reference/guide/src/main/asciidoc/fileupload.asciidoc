== Juzu File Upload Plugin

The file upload plugin integrates http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/[Apache Commons FileUpload] in Juzu. The plugin
decodes multipart requests as file objects and can inject them as controller method parameters. This plugin works
with the servlet bridge and the portlet bridge.

=== File upload in an action phase

File upload can be handled during an action of a portlet or a servlet:

[source,java]
----
@Action
@Route("/upload")
public void upload(org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem file) {
   if (file != null) {
      // Handle the file upload
   }
}
----

NOTE: The +@Route+ annotation is only meaningfull for the servlet bridge. In case of a portlet, the URL
is managed by the portal.

=== File upload in a resource phase

File upload can also be handled in a resource phase.

[source,java]
----
@Resource
@Route("/upload")
public Response.Content upload(org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem file) {
   if (file != null) {
      // Handle the file upload
   }
   return Response.ok("Upload is done");
}
----

Handling upload in a resource phase can be used when the file is uploaded via Ajax: the application
 does not want a view phase to be triggered after the upload.
