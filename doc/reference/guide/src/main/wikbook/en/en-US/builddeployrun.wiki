We will see in this chapter how to build and deploy a Juzu application.

= Build =

Building a Juzu application is usually done in two steps

* Compile the application to its binary representation
* Package the application as a war file

Compiling an application requires a few jars to be present on the compilation classpath:

* The Juzu core jar for the Juzu API
* The JSR-330 jar for the @Inject API
* Any Juzu extension jar such as plugins or additinal template engines

After compilation, classes need to be packaged as a web application archive (//war//) and then deployed in a server. We
will show several ways to package a Juzu application.

{{note}}
At the moment Juzu focuses on Maven because it is built with Maven, however that does not mean that Juzu is coupled
to Maven, in the future we will provide additional examples or quickstart for alternative build systems.

== With Maven ==

Juzu libraries are deployed in the [[Maven Central repository>>http://search.maven.org/]], compiling an application
 with require a few dependencies to find the correct jars.

=== Using the Juzu Maven //bom// ===

The //bom// is a Juzu artifact that serves the purpose of building and packaging an application:

1. provide a set of dependencies that will be sufficient for compiling the application using its Maven transitive dependencies
1. provide a predefined assembly descriptor that creates a war file containing the application classes, resources and libraries

To achieve the first step, we simply declare the following dependency in a Maven artifact:

{{xml}}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.juzu</groupId>
  <artifactId>juzu-bom-core</artifactId>
  <version>$[juzu.version]</version>
</dependency>
{{/xml}}

Assembling the application requires more XML but is very straightforward:

{{xml}}
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.juzu</groupId>
      <artifactId>juzu-bom-core</artifactId>
      <version>$[juzu.version]</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>single</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <configuration>
        <descriptorRefs>
          <descriptorRef>tomcat-guice</descriptorRef>
        </descriptorRefs>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
{{/xml}}

The //assembly// plugin takes care of packaging the application:

1. The plugin dependency declares on the //juzu-bom-core// artifact because it contains the predefined descriptors such
 as the ##tomcat-guice## descriptor
1. The goal //single// of the assembly plugin is executed during the //package// phase
1. The predefined descriptor //tomcat-guice// packages the application for the Tomcat server and with the Guice framework
11. Any dependency on the application is packaged in //WEB-INF/lib//
11. The application classes are copied in //WEB-INF/classes//
11. The web application //src/main/webapp// files are copied to the root of the archive
11. Specific deployment descriptors may be copied in the war file depending on the predefined descriptor

In this example we used the //tomcat-guice// predefined descriptor. The bom relies on the
[[Maven Assembly plugin>>http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/]], Juzu provides the
[[predefined assembly descriptors>>http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/descriptor-refs.html]]
that makes easy to package a Juzu application:


(% title="The predefined descriptors" %)
|=     |=tomcat       |=gatein       |=liferay
|all   |tomcat        |gatein        |liferay
|guice |tomcat-guice  |gatein-guice  |liferay-guice
|spring|tomcat-spring |gatein-spring |liferay-spring
|cdi   |tomcat-cdi    |gatein-cdi    |liferay-cdi

{{note}}
The predefined assembly descriptor does a similar job to the Maven //war// packaging but with more flexibility. To achieve
the same result, the usage of a war packaging with the overlay feature.

=== Juzu archetype ===

The following produces a base Juzu application for Tomcat with the Guice injection container:

{{example title='Generating an application for the Tomcat server and the Guice injection container'}}
{{screen}}
mvn archetype:generate \\
   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.juzu \\
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=juzu-archetype \\
   -DarchetypeVersion=$[juzu.version] \\
   -DgroupId=org.example \\
   -DartifactId=myapp \\
   -DpackageName=org.example.myapp \\
   -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
{{/screen}}
{{/example}}

The generated application is a quickstart ready to can be customzed for developing more complex applications.
The archetype uses the packager described in the previous section.

It is possible to generate the application for a different server and injection container:

{{example title='Generating an application for the Tomcat server and the Spring injection container'}}
{{screen}}
mvn archetype:generate \\
   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.juzu \\
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=juzu-archetype \\
   -DarchetypeVersion=$[juzu.version] \\
   -DgroupId=org.example \\
   -DartifactId=myapp \\
   -DpackageName=org.example.myapp \\
   -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \\
   -DjuzuServer=tomcat \\
   -DjuzuInject=spring
{{/screen}}
{{/example}}

== Using a prepackaged application ==

The Juzu distribution contains the Booking and Tutorial applications for GateIn and Liferay servers. They can be used
as basis to create applications.

== Using an IDE ==

Juzu uses Annotation Processing Tool to perform many tasks at compilation time. APT is a standard extension of a Java compiler.
All Java IDE (Eclipse, Intellij and Netbeans) provide good support for APT, we will show in the section how to configure
and uses APT within those IDEs.

IDEs provide also Maven support, we will focus in this section on using APT without the Maven support. Indeed the APT support
may work differently when using Maven in your project, the Maven and APT support within IDEs has a dedicated section.

= Deploy =

At the moment the supported (i.e tested) portal servers are

* Tomcat 6.x and 7.x
* GateIn 3.2 / 3.3 / 3.4 and 3.5
* Liferay 6.1

Other server may work but we are not aware of that as it was not tested in other environments.

== Tomcat ==

No specific deployment instruction.

== GateIn ==

=== GateIn on Tomcat 6/7===

No specific deployment instruction.

=== GateIn on JBoss AS 7 ===

GateIn on JBoss AS7 requires a little modification to do:

Open the file //modules/javax/api/main/module.xml// and add **//<path name="javax/annotation/processing"/>//** among the //paths// declaration:

{{xml}}
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="javax.api">
  <dependencies>
    <system export="true">
      <paths>
        <path name="javax/annotation/processing"/>
        ...
      </paths>
    </system>
  </dependencies>
</module>
{{/xml}}

This configuration exposes the ##javax.annotation.processing## package to the classes seen by Juzu.

== Liferay ==

Liferay has been tested extensively with the Tomcat version, no specific deployment instruction is required.

= Run =

== Run modes ==

Juzu defines three modes for running an application, called //run modes//:

* Production (//prod//): error reporting is minimal
* Development (//dev//): provides verbose error reporting
* Live (//live//): allow to develop the application live with verbose error reporting

== How to choose the right run mode ==

* When you are running an application use the //prod// run mode
* When you are developing an application with a build system use the //dev// run mode
* When you are live developing an application use the //live// run mode

== Configuring the run mode ==

Run mode is configured via servlet context parameters, by default the //prod// mode is enabled:

* //juzu.run_mode// : possible values //prod//, //dev// or //live//
* //juzu.src_path// : the source path of the source to compile for the live mode

{{example title="Configuring the dev mode in web.xml"}}
{{xml}}
<context-param>
  <param-name>juzu.run_mode</param-name>
  <param-value>dev</param-value>
</context-param>
