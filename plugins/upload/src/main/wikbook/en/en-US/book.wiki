= Juzu File Upload Plugin =

The file upload plugin integrates [[Apache Commons FileUpload>>http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/]] in Juzu. The plugin
decodes multipart requests as file objects and can inject them as controller method parameters. This plugin works
with the servlet bridge and the portlet bridge.

== File upload in an action phase ==

File upload can be handled during an action of a portlet or a servlet:

{{java}}
@Action
@Route("/upload")
public void upload(org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUpload file) {
   if (file != null) {
      // Handle the file upload
   }
}
{{/java}}

{{note}}The ##@Route## annotation is only meaningfull for the servlet bridge. In case of a portlet, the URL
is managed by the portal.{{/note}}

== File upload in a resource phase ==

File upload can also be handled in a resource phase.

{{java}}
@Resource
@Route("/upload")
public Response.Content upload(org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUpload file) {
   if (file != null) {
      // Handle the file upload
   }
   return Response.ok("Upload is done");
}
{{/java}}

Handling upload in a resource phase can be used when the file is uploaded via Ajax: the application
 does not want a view phase to be triggered after the upload.
